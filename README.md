Office Caltech Domain 10 Domain Adaptation Dataset

It seems that the link to the original owner of the Office Caltech 10 Domain Adaptation is broken. 
Further, i haven't found any other source where the original images of the dataset are easy to download. 
With this repo, i hope to make the dataset download easy and transparent for other researchers. 

If you got another more useful download resource or error in the citation, please contact me!
